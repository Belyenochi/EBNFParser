Ruiko Language
------------------------------

**Ruiko** is EBNF-like language for tokenizing and parsing which could handle context-sensitive cases easily(`closure` could be handled in **Ruiko**).

What's more, you can even write the compiling actions easily when writing parsers, and the efficiency might be amazing high.
